# ERASMUPS

**ERASMUPS** - a website where students interested (or already enrolled) in ERASMUS related to UP (Erasmus In or Erasmus Out) can expose their doubts and everyone can see and clarify them.

## Product

Our product consists of a Q&A forum website, focused on ERASMUS related to the University of Porto. There is a badge/achievement system, in order to keep users active and engaging with other users. Additionally, there is a moderation system, with a user trust level associated, in order to keep the website tidy and clean.  
This artifact results from the implementation of the platform designed previously, using PostgreSQL as a database management system and PHP and Laravel for generating dynamic web pages.
